    I always had a creative mind. I'm constantly daydreaming about stories, characters, scenarios.
    Being able to create is something I want to be able to achieve. The problem is, i'm lazy and I don't want to put in the work to develop andy skill. To help my kick this bad habit of mine, 
    I've decided that joining CodeStack is the first step in my journey towards passionate creation!
